===== Web App - Surveys =====

The basic features of the iPhone app are also available from the web, so you can take a survey without a mobile device.  You can visit this page to take surveys: https://lausd.mobilizingcs.org/survey or by clicking the "Take Survey" link from the frontend dashboard. This is a very straightforward process and is detailed below. First, when you tap on the survey icon from the mobile application main menu, you will be asked which survey you would like to take. If you don't currently have any surveys on this screen, you can add some via the [[:app:iphone:campaigns|Campaigns]] area. Tap a survey to begin taking it!

Now, you can take the survey.  Below is an example of the "Snack" survey from the ECS Unit 5 curriculum.  Once you have completed the survey, tap the "submit" button.  Note: once you have tapped submit, you will no longer be able to edit any of your responses.
