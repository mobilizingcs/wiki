===== Math - Mobilize ONESTOP =====
This wiki provides a single page with a step-by-step process (and all necessary links) required to participate in the Mobilize unit. All materials you'll need to implement the Mobilize Math curriculum can be found at [[https://dropbox.mobilizingcs.org/public.php?service=files&t=c216f15e36922da303c3576aa561aa9a|Mobilize Curriculum Directory]]. The link will take you to the general directory for all Mobilize curricula. Just click on the folder marked "MZ Curriculum_Math" to find current versions of the Mobilize Math Unit, PowerPoints, Student Handouts, and Additional Teacher Resources. 

All URLs related to the Mobilize tools and applications are listed on [[https://wiki.mobilizingcs.org/urls]].


==== Step 1 (Week+ before starting unit) - Handling Consent Forms or Information Sheets ====
  * **Teachers implementing in multiple class periods should select ONE class period as their "evaluation class"** or class that completed the questionnaires.  Please try to select a "typical class" (i.e., not honors class), preferably Alg. 1.
  * Classes will either be in a BLUE group or a GOLD group. 
  * BLUE GROUP:  Please make sure to give students the Student Information Sheet to read through and the Parent Information Sheets to share with their parents.
  * GOLD GROUP: Please give students the Mobilize Consent Form Packet (student consent form, parent consent form) to complete. The consent forms are needed to  help us measure and improve the effectiveness of the Mobilize units. Bring back completed forms to the **September 13 PD** (It is OK to bring in any additional signed forms to the October PD).
  * Please feel free to contact us at support@mobilizingcs.org with any questions or concerns.
  * THANK YOU!

// ** __Consent Forms:__** //
 Student and Parent Consent forms for the 2015-16 academic year will be posted by late August 2015.

==== Step 2 (Week+ before starting unit) - Check software; Create classes and accounts ==== 
  * {{:wiki:computer-3.png?nolink&20}} Teachers make sure that they and their students will have access a computer lab that satisfies the [[https://wiki.mobilizingcs.org/requirements|minimum software requirements]]. 
  * To prevent a blank screen issue due to the LAUSD firewall, please follow [[http://www.lausd.k12.ca.us/lausd/help_files/cert_filter.htm| the LAUSD instructions for installing their root certificate]] on your and your students' browsers. 
  * {{:wiki:mobilize_finallogo_cmyk.png?nolink&60|}} Each Mobilize teacher creates their own classes and student accounts by following [[https://wiki.mobilizingcs.org/app/web/teacher|the Mobilize Class Setup Process]]. For the upcoming deployment, we will execute this step during the PD on Sep 7, 2013. 


==== Step 3 (Day 0) - Students Take the "Pre-Q" ====
  * {{:wiki:document-edit.png?nolink&20|}} Teachers administer the student pre-questionnaire (or "Pre-Q") BEFORE beginning the unit. 
  * The Pre-Q includes a series of algebra and data-related tasks and should take approximately 30 minutes (1 class period including directions, passing out Pre-Q's, etc.) to complete.  The gold group questionnaire is slightly longer.  
  * Teachers will also be asked to complete a short pre-survey before starting the unit.  You will receive a link via email. 
  * Contact Debbie La Torre Matrundola at 310.206.1385 or support@mobilizingcs.org  if you have any questions or concerns. 

// ** __Target Story__** //
When your students have completed the "Pre-Q" you will have time to present the Target Story; a brief video discussing data collection practices by large corporations. (Time: 4.5 minutes) When the video ends, ask students, "How did Target know she was pregnant?" Discuss first as teams and have each team share out.

==== Step 4 (Day 1) - Implement Lesson 1: Life with Big Data ====
Objective: Students reflect on what are data, how it is collected and used. Students are introduced to the unit question: How do data affect me now and in the future?

Common Core State Standards & Mathematical Practices:
  MP2 - Reason abstractly and quantitatively

==== Step 5 (Day 2) - Implement Lesson 2: Forming Conjectures ====
Objective: Students will learn to form questions and make predictions about data. They will make predictions that can be phrased as “I predict that…” and be able to identify types of data and variables present.

Common Core Standards & Mathematical Practices:
  NQ2 - Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of descriptive modeling.
  NQ3 - Choose a level of accuracy appropriate to limitations on measurement when reporting quantities.
  MP3 - Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.

  * Student HO1 Set the Scene Activity - Snack Times

==== Step 6 (Day 3) - Implement Lesson 3: Statistical Questions & the Data Cycle ====
Objective: Students formalize statistical questions and understand the flow of the Data Cycle.  Students upload and use the Mobilize Snack Campaign to collect data about their personal snack consumption. *Note to teacher: try to schedule this lesson for a Friday or day before a weekend so that students can collect data over multiple days.

Common Core Standards & Mathematical Practices:
  NQ1 - Use units as a way to understand problems and to guide the solution of multi-step problems; choose and interpret units consistently in formulas; choose and interpret the scale and the origin in graphs and data displays.
  NQ2 - Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of descriptive modeling.
  NQ3 - Choose a level of accuracy appropriate to limitations on measurement when reporting quantities
  MP6 - Attend to precision.
  MP7 - Look for and make use of structure.

==== Step 7 (Day 4-5) - Implement Lesson 4: Data Generated Expressions and Equations  ====
Objective: Day 1 - Students continue to collect data, create standards for having productive discussions regarding collected data (non-attacking), and begin to explore the dashboard to introduce writing expressions and equations from data.
Day 2 - Students create expressions and equations to better quantify their data and give values to their predictions and questions.

Common Core Standards & Mathematical Practices:
  A-SSE1 Interpret expressions that represent a quantity in terms of its context
  A-CED1 Create equations and inequalities in one variable including ones with absolute value and use them to solve problems in and out of context, including equations arising from linear functions.
  MP1 - Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
  MP2 - Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
  MP5 - Use appropriate tools strategically.

==== Step 8 (Day 6) - Implement Lesson 5: Categorical versus Quantitative Data ====
  * In this lesson, students will determine how their perceived healthiness correspond to reality. 
  * Students will consider the questions: “What does my data tell me about nutrition?” and “What is healthy nutrition?” 
  * In expert groups, students will read articles on health and nutrition for teens and will justify or refine their initial ideas about nutrition and health.
